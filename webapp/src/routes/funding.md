# Operational Expenses and Funding 💰

## Operational Expenses

I architected the serverside code to be as light and portable as possible. Currently, it runs on a VPS I rent for about **7$/month**. This is currently the only operational expense for Noteshare.space.

The storage requirements for hosting encrypted text data are incredible small; at the time of writing (28 September, 2022), Noteshare is storing **1,000 notes in a little over 7MB**.

### Future expenses: hosting file attachments

For those who have read [the roadmap](/roadmap), I am working on supporting embedded images and file attachments in a future update. As you can imagine, this greatly increases the storage requirements, as just one attachement has a size in the order of megabytes.

As I develop this feature, I am still deciding on how I will fund this: community donors, tiered access, ... If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:contact@noteshare.space) or the [community Discord](https://discord.gg/y3HqyGeABK).

## Funding

I already rented this VPS for other purposes, so I haven no problem paying out of pocket for hosting and you can expect the service to be available

If you wish to financially support me and the development of this plugin and service, you can send donations via my [_Buy me a coffee_-profile](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mcndt).

## Self-hosting

If you are still worried about relying on me for keeping Noteshare up and running, it is an option to host your own instance of Noteshare. You can find the source code, as well as a `docker-compose.yml` file to get you up and running on the [Noteshare GitHub repo](https://github.com/mcndt/Noteshare.space).
